### Write Markdown
- [VSCode Markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) - if you happen to already be using VSCode, this is a very handy tool that lets you preview your Markdown in realtime. If you're using another code editor like Atom, etc., there's probably a plugin or built-in way to have similar functionality.

## Config
Hugo uses both YAML and TOML. You don't have to learn either (you can just copy-and-paste existing files, and editing is usually fairly obvious) but sometimes it's nice to understand.

## Terminal/Command Line/Command Prompt

### Quick Cheat Sheet

#### Navigate Directories (Folders) using the Command Line

```sh
cd foldername
# Enter directory "foldername" inside your current directory
```
```sh
cd ..
# Enter parent directory of current directory
```
#### Preview Your Site

1. ```sh
   cd <path/to/site>
   ```
2. Run `hugo server` in the directory (folder) where your site is. It will start a local version of your website on your machine that updates as you edit it. You can see it by copy-and-pasting the URL (it will look like http://localhost:1313) into your web browser.
3. When you're done, open your terminal and press `CTRL+C` (NOT `CMD+C`, even on a Mac) to stop the server.
